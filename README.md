# Route Weather JS #

## Initial Project Roadmap ##

1. What is the goal of the project?
    - Update/rework the existing [route-weather](https://github.com/jasonmlutz/route-weather) using JavaScript.
    - Make the result interactive using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
1.  Who is the target audience?
    - At this point, just  me.
1. What are your personal learning goals?
    - Learn JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
1. What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
    - HTML/CSS & JavaScript
    - Data from APIs
        - [Historical and future weather data](https://darksky.net/poweredby/)
        - [Driving directions](https://www.mapbox.com/)
1. What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
    - Integration with 3rd party APIs.
1. What does success look like for this project? What does _done_ mean?
    - Initial success will be recreating the same functionality of the CLI-based [route-weather](https://github.com/jasonmlutz/route-weather) using JavaScript instead of Python.
    - The final project will take input from the user (origin, destination, departure time) and display driving
  directions paired with weather forecasts for each step of the trip (at the time of arrival at each checkpoint).
    - Long-term: integrate interactive visual map displaying route and weather (as opposed to only a printable list).
